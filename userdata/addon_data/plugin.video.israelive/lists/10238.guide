Ward grew up in the supremely tough working-class neighbourhood of Lowell, Massachusetts, and, in the 1990s, aimed for the classic escape from that environment - via boxing. Indeed, his brother Dicky Eklund once showed promise in the sport - but that was a decade ago, before he succumbed to drug addiction. Now Dicky is Micky's coach and, keeping it in the family, his ferocious mother Alice is his manager. But do either of his 'support staff' have what it takes to unlock his full potential? Ward's girlfriend Charlene thinks not and is agitating for change. Will the good-natured pugilist put ambition before blood loyalty? Bale and Leo both picked up Academy Awards for their supporting roles in the drama. David O Russell's Oscar-winning boxing drama is screened on Film4 two nights before the release of the director's new film Joy."}, {"start": 1451533200, "image": null, "end": 1451559600, "name": "Off Air", "description": ""}, {"start": 1451559600, "image": "http://static.filmon.com/assets/tvguide/image%2F27093%2F2%2F27093-SwissFami-13558650590/poster-350x229.jpg", "end": 1451568900, "name": "Swiss Family Robinson", "description": "On the run from the Napoleonic regime, the Robinson family head for a new life in New Guinea.

He offers a compelling performance in a variation of these earlier roles in this suspense filled and politically loaded tale of intrigue. The story opens in German-occupied Athens during the darkest hours of the war. Civilians are not allowed on the streets after dark. Dantine plays Demetri Alexander, and the first time he appears on screen he is garbed in a Nazi uniform. It is midnight, and Demetri prowls the streets of the city. He comes upon a shocking sight: the corpse of a young man who was hanged in a town square by the Germans because he was suspected of being a Communist. However, despite his appearance Demetri is neither Nazi collaborator nor Gestapo hooligan. He is a Greek officer who soon leaves Athens and sets out on a perilous journey. He is aided in no small way by the title character. She is the stunningly exotic Zaira, one in a group of patriotic gypsies who have joined the Greek underground and are putting their lives on the line daily in a battle against those who have occupied their country. Demetri and Zaira share an intricate and deeply felt relationship, one which is destined to involve them in further conflict and confrontation at several pivotal moments in the history of modern Greece."}, {"start": 1451488831, "image": null, "end": 1451493724, "name": "Lovers On A Tightrope", "description": "Cora, the wife of a wealthy Parisian businessman, Daniel, is involved in an affair with Henri, an unscrupulous garage mechanic.
